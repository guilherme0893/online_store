# Introduction

This application is simulation of an e-commerce application. It consisits of a home page where the products are load, a detail page for each product, the cart page and the checkout page. This project was initially developed at Trybe using React and classes, but for current repository Context API and Hooks were used. Following the original project, endpoints from Mercado Livre API were used (https://developers.mercadolivre.com.br/pt_br/api-docs-pt-br). 

# Features

The application provides a intuitive usage as all actions are clearly indicated by the buttons. It is possible to see different products and different categories, and send them to the shopping cart -- the products are saved in the local storage, so the user does not loose the data when leaving the page. 

# How to use it 
   
1) First of all clone the repository via <code> git clone </code>  and enter into the folder 

2) Then install the dependencies via <code> npm install </code>

3) To run the application simply run <code> npm start </code>

4) Have fun
